       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F
              Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).  If N is more  than  the  screen  size,  only  the  final
              screenful is displayed.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a special literalization character.

       b or ^B or ESC-v
              Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).  If N is more than  the  screen  size,  only  the  final
              screenful is displayed.

       ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
              Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

       y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K
              Scroll  backward  N  lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.  Warning:
              some systems use ^Y as a special job control character.

       g or < or ESC-<
              Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)

       /pattern
              Search  forward  in  the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.  N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a regular expres‐
              sion, as recognized by the regular expression library supplied by your system.  The search starts at the  first  line  dis‐
              played (but see the -a and -j options, which change this).
       ?pattern
              Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.  The search starts at the last  line  displayed  (but
              see the -a and -j options, which change this).
              
	      ^K     Highlight any text which matches the pattern on the current screen, but don't move to the first match (KEEP  current
                     position).

       ESC-u  Undo  search  highlighting.   Turn off highlighting of strings matching the current search pattern.  If highlighting is al‐
              ready off because of a previous ESC-u command, turn highlighting back on.  Any search command will also  turn  highlighting
              back on.  (Highlighting can also be disabled by toggling the -G option; in that case search commands do not turn highlight‐
              ing back on.)
		     
       &pattern
              Display  only  lines  which match the pattern; lines which do not match the pattern are not displayed.  If pattern is empty
              (if you type & immediately followed by ENTER), any filtering is turned off, and all lines are displayed.   While  filtering
              is  in  effect,  an ampersand is displayed at the beginning of the prompt, as a reminder that some lines in the file may be
              hidden.  Multiple & commands may be entered, in which case only lines which match all of the patterns will be displayed.

       n      Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pattern.  If the previous search was modified by ^N,  the  search
              is  made  for the N-th line NOT containing the pattern.  If the previous search was modified by ^E, the search continues in
              the next (or previous) file if not satisfied in the current file.  If the previous search was modified by ^R, the search is
              done without using regular expressions.  There is no effect if the previous search was modified by ^F or ^K.

       N      Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction.


       :e [filename]
              Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing, the "current" file (see the :n and :p commands below)  from  the  list  of
              files  in the command line is re-examined.  A percent sign (%) in the filename is replaced by the name of the current file.
              A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously examined file.  However, two consecutive percent signs are  sim‐
              ply  replaced  with  a  single percent sign.  This allows you to enter a filename that contains a percent sign in the name.
              Similarly, two consecutive pound signs are replaced with a single pound sign.  The filename is inserted  into  the  command
              line  list  of  files  so that it can be seen by subsequent :n and :p commands.  If the filename consists of several files,
              they are all inserted into the list of files and the first one is examined.  If the filename contains one or  more  spaces,
              the entire filename should be enclosed in double quotes (also see the -" option).

       :n     Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command line).  If a number N is specified, the N-th  next  file
              is examined.

       :p     Examine the previous file in the command line list.  If a number N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.

       :x     Examine the first file in the command line list.  If a number N is specified, the N-th file in the list is examined.

       :d     Remove the current file from the list of files.

       = or ^G or :f
              Prints some information about the file being viewed, including its name and the line number and byte offset of  the  bottom
              line  being displayed.  If possible, it also prints the length of the file, the number of lines in the file and the percent
              of the file above the last displayed line.

       v      Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed.  The editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL  if  de‐
              fined,  or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to "vi" if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined.  See also the dis‐
              cussion of LESSEDIT under the section on PROMPTS below.

       -jn or --jump-target=n
              Specifies  a  line on the screen where the "target" line is to be positioned.  The target line is the line specified by any
              command to search for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag.  The screen line may be
              specified  by a number: the top line on the screen is 1, the next is 2, and so on.  The number may be negative to specify a
              line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so  on.
              Alternately,  the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5
              is in the middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on.  If the  line  is  specified  as  a
              fraction,  the actual line number is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains at the
              specified fraction of the screen height.  If any form of the -j option is used, repeated forward searches (invoked with "n"
              or  "N")  begin at the line immediately after the target line, and repeated backward searches begin at the target line, un‐
              less changed by -a or -A.  For example, if "-j4" is used, the target line is the fourth line  on  the  screen,  so  forward
              searches  begin  at  the fifth line on the screen.  However nonrepeated searches (invoked with "/" or "?")  always begin at
              the start or end of the current screen respectively.

       -n or --line-numbers
              Suppresses line numbers.  The default (to use line numbers) may cause less to run more slowly  in  some  cases,  especially
              with  a  very  large  input file.  Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem.  Using line numbers
              means: the line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the = command, and the v command will pass  the  cur‐
              rent line number to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).

       -N or --LINE-NUMBERS
              Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of each line in the display.

       --line-num-width
              Sets the minimum width of the line number field when the -N option is in effect.  The default is 7 characters.

       The -P option allows you to tailor the prompt to your preference.  The string given to the -P option replaces the specified prompt
       string.  Certain characters in the string are interpreted specially.  The prompt mechanism is rather complicated to provide flexi‐
       bility, but the ordinary user need not understand the details of constructing personalized prompt strings.

       %f     Replaced by the name of the current input file.

       EDITOR The name of the editor (used for the v command).

       -S sessionname
            When  creating  a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session. This name identifies the
            session for screen -list and screen -r actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix. This name should not be  longer
            then 80 symbols.

       -t name
            sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified program.  See also the shelltitle .screenrc command.

       -X   Send  the  specified command to a running screen session. You may use the -S option to specify the screen session if you have
            several screen sessions running. You can use the -d or -r option to tell screen to look only for attached or detached  screen
            sessions. Note that this command doesn't work if the session is password protected.

       -s program
            sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the value in the environment variable $SHELL (or /bin/sh  if  not
            defined).  This can also be defined through the shell .screenrc command.  See also there.

       C-a '              (select)          Prompt for a window name or number
                                            to switch to.
 
       C-a A              (title)           Allow the user to enter a name for
                                            the current window.

       C-a c,             (screen)          Create a new window with  a  shell
       C-a C-c                              and switch to that window.
 
       C-a >              (writebuf)        Write paste buffer to a file.
       
       C-a <              (readbuf)         Reads  the  screen-exchange   file
                                            into the paste buffer.
       
       C-a =              (removebuf)       Removes the file used by C-a < and
                                            C-a >.
